auto_tumblr.py
==============

 auto_tumblr.py is a small python script that scans a directory and emails the 
 files placed in to a specified email address. I use to update my Tumblr blog.

 Inspired by: http://micampe.it/things/flickruploadr


How to use this
---------------

 IMPORTANT: I'm not responsible for anything this script does. 

 The script scans the folder (TUMBLR_DIR) and it's subfolders and emails files 
 it finds in there to TUMBLR_EMAIL. The subfolders are used as tags in the post. 
 So you can tag your stuff by creating subfolders. 

 Here's a nice write up of how to use this script. Just replace uploadr.py 
 with auto_tumblr.py
